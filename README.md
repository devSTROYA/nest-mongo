## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve nest-mongo`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. Happy coding!


## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build nest-mongo` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
